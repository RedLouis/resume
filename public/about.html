    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello there! I'm a former social worker hailing from the picturesque Netherlands. While my journey started
        in the realm of social work, I've embarked on an exciting new adventure in the world of coding and programming.</p>

    <p>My trusty companions on this coding journey are <code>HTML</code>, <code>CSS</code>, <code>JavaScript</code>, <code>Java</code>,
        <code>Python</code>, <code>C</code>, and <code>C#</code>. You'll often find me immersed in courses
        from platforms like Udemy, EdX, and FreeCodeCamp, eagerly soaking up knowledge to expand
        my coding horizons. My closest friend in this pursuit? None other than the ever-reliable Google, guiding
        me through the intricacies of programming and problem-solving.</p>

    <p>From aiding individuals in need to crafting lines of code and applications, my transition has been nothing short of remarkable.
        I've also been actively involved in teaching Word, Windows, and Excel as a volunteer, leveraging my tech skills
        to help others. Additionally, I've been repairing Windows PCs for many years, further deepening my love for technology.</p>

    <p>Recently I started with moderating in a Facebook group about <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/coding4beginners">Coding for beginners</a>.
        It is cool to share my knowledge from my journey and learn from other participants in the group.</p>

    <p>I am always happy to help people, so if you have questions <a href="./contact.html">contact me</a>.</p>
